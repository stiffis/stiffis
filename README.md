# Helloüëã!!

I'm Steve, CS student and VIM lover.

Focused on understanding new emerging technologies, such as AI, Neural Networks and, why not, game development.

I like to customize my workspace, that's why I use Linux (soon my dotfiles..).

C++ is my pookie, long life to pointers *****

## Things I like ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Python, C++  

- Maths (especially Calculus, Discrete, Geometry, Trigonometry and my sweetie, Algebra)

- Linux

- Read about philosophy and psychology

- Vimkeys :D
