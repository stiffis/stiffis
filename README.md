# HelloðŸ‘‹!!

I'm stiff.is, an 18 year old guy who likes code a lot.

I'm focused on understanding new emerging technologies, such as AI, Neural Networks and, why not, game development.

I love to customize my workspace, that's why I use Linux (soon my dotflies..).

I use Python for most of my projects, but I'm learning C++ for memory control.
