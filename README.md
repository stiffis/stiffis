# Hello👋!!

I'm stiffis, an 18 year old guy who likes code a lot.

Focused on understanding new emerging technologies, such as AI, Neural Networks and, why not, game development.

I like to customize my workspace, that's why I use Linux (soon my dotflies..).

Use Python for most of my projects, but I'm learning C++ for memory control.

## Things I love ❤️

- Python, C++  

- Maths (especially Calculus, Discrete, Geometry, Trigonometry and my sweetie, Algebra)

- Linux

- My friends

- My family

>I hope to do some good with all this.
